description="Drop spatial markers anywhere in your 3D world to pin bugs, notes, polish ideas, or feedback, screenshots, videos, and priorities. Jump between issues via a searchable list, resolve them with checkboxes, and add quick non-spatial todos. Keeps your massive open world organized without external apps."
