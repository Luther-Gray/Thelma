# My name is Luther. And one of my favorite things to do, is lie to my players.

Something I've always appreciated about Yoko Taro,
Hidetaka Miyazaki, and Hideo Kojima, is their willingness, or perhaps, their eagerness, to shove their player's faces into the dirt and stomp down on the back of their heads. Whether that punishment comes in the form of esoteric gameplay systems, blatant threats of lost progress, or disgusting and manipulative tactics to make the Player feel like trash, I've learned to love these stabs in the heart the more I've been exposed to them.

In a long forgotten GDC talk, Yoko Taro presents this idea of the Invisible Wall. There are various interpretations of what this is in the Game Design sphere, but my take is the invisible wall are the things that you really should not be doing to the player. At the top of this list for me is threaten your player's belief in your game's integrity.

That can take the form of save files, a sacred thing that should never be manipulated, but in my view, I think the jucier thing to mess with is interpretation of systems.

NPC Dialogue, underlying and unexplained mechanics, vague attributes and strange twists on tropes. There's a risk of upending how your player percieves a game and throw them into a feeling of alienation. Like this *thing* doesn't seem to mesh with how something like it should be. A chair that stays upright when you sit in it, but it has no legs.

It says it's an action-adventure game. It kinda is one. And it's not really an RPG. Or anything in particular. If we attatch subgenres, it starts to look more like a list of abilities rather than a succict way to sum this game up. When you describe it to a friend, they can't really understand what you're saying.

As someone digging into the game-files I thought it might be worth it to leave a marker here for you to understand why I design things the way I do. And it's also worth telling you what I made Thelma to be.

Thelma is an Isekai-RPG. But it is also another world. It is a world designed to house your soul after you die. And I want you to feel that after it's too late.
